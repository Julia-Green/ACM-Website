              <p>Every other Wednesday, chapter members are encouraged to attend our business meetings. During these meetings, the chapter discusses our weekly agenda and votes on individual items. Here, current projects are discussed, budgets are proposed, and
                future chapter events are planned. An open floor is also held for members to propose new projects, ideas, and plans. </p>
              <p>The following Wednesday after each Business Meeting, the chapter hosts an Activity Meeting. In each of these meetings, the chapter is presented with a speaker, coding lecture, or challenge. We have had speakers from companies such as First Orion, Metova, and Twitch in the past and plan to have many more in the future. Our past coding lectures include topics such as Git, computer vision, and threading while some of our coding challenges have included our own version of fizzbuzz and a perfect numbers challenge. We are also known to sometimes present an algorithm or logic puzzle durring our Activity Meetings. These puzzles may include traditional computer science puzzles like the Two Generals or Travelling Salesman problems and are used to help members practice
                their logical and problem solving skills. For the remainder of the meeting, members work together to hone their programming and logic skills to find a solution to the challenge or puzzle.<br>

                the environment for ACM members to come together as more than just a chapter. Fun Friday activities are member proposed and voted on at each Wednesday Business meeting, so each event is curated to suit the taste of all those who attend.

                <p class="text-left">On November 2nd, the ACM Student Chapter of UA Little Rock came together to participate in the 24 hour Extra Life Charity livestream. From noon Saturday to noon Sunday, we played video and tabletop games continuously for an online audience
                  to raise money for the Arkansas Children’s Hospital. Of the time spent streaming, a significant portion was dedicated to Dungeons & Dragons. The first session involved the players in a deadly game of Siegeball: an amalgamation of soccer,
                  rugby, and gladiatorial combat. After a short intermission and some more traditional video games, the second session involved the players investigating the mystery of a small hamlet conquered by a monarch 30 years prior.
                </p>
                <p class="text-left">By noon of the second day, everyone was extremely tired. The streamers, despite taking shifts to sleep for an hour or two in the corner, were still going strong playing their games on stream in hopes of raising money. By noon, everyone
                  said their goodbyes to their online audience and began to pack up to go home for some much deserved rest. Overall, the Extra Life Charity Livestream was a success. The ACM Student Chapter of UA Little Rock looks forward to participating
                  again to raise money for sick children in need.
