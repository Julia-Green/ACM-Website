In lieu of our regular, in-person meetings, our Project, Activity, and Friday Funday meetings are all occurring online via Google Meet. You can find each meeting’s corresponding Google Meets link under its event tab on both our events and calendar pages. The meeting links are also posted to our slack and sent out via email.

              <p>Every other Wednesday, chapter members are encouraged to attend our project meetings. During these meetings, the chapter discusses our agenda and votes on individual items. Here, current projects are discussed, budgets are proposed, and
                future chapter events are planned. An open floor is also held for members to propose new projects, ideas, and plans. </p>
              <p>The following Wednesday after each project meeting, the chapter hosts an activity meeting. In each of these meetings, the chapter is presented with a speaker, coding lecture, or challenge. We have had speakers from companies such as First Orion, Metova, and Twitch in the past and plan to have many more in the future. Our past coding lectures include topics such as Git, computer vision, and threading while some of our coding challenges have included our own version of fizzbuzz and a perfect numbers challenge. We are also known to sometimes present an algorithm or logic puzzle durring our activity meetings. These puzzles may include traditional computer science puzzles like the Two Generals or Travelling Salesman problems and are used to help members practice
                their logical and problem solving skills. For the remainder of the meeting, members work together to hone their programming and logic skills to find a solution to the challenge or puzzle.<br>

              <p>The Friday Fun Day is true to its namesake. Every Friday, the ACM convenes to play video games, tabletop games, watch movies, visit a coffeehouse, ETC. Not only does the event serve the purpose of recreation, but the Friday Fun Day also provides
                the environment for ACM members to come together as more than just a chapter. Fun Friday activities are member proposed and voted on at each Wednesday project meeting, so each event is curated to suit the taste of all those who attend.

                    The UA Little Rock Association for Computing Machinery Chapter assisted the Arkansas Department of Education by presenting at the CS Tech Fest.
                    Brandon Norman, the Vice Chair of our ACM Chapter, gave a brief introduction to emergent behavior through his Boids application. He detailed how emergent behavior plays a role in systems all around us, then went on to show how emergent behaviors can be simulated using a set of simple rules with a simulation of a flock of birds. He engaged both children and their parents in the presentation, and was able to show them how computer science can be used to better understand our everyday lives.</p>

From noon Saturday to noon on Sunday, members streamed themselves playing video and tabletop games continuously for an online audience to raise money for the Arkansas Children’s Hospital. For most of the event, members streamed individually or in small groups. However, Saturday evening all members came together to play several games as a group.

                  <p class="text-left">We received 36 donations in all and surpassed our original goal of $1,000. In total, we managed to raise $1,256 with our highest donation being $600. Overall, the Extra Life Charity Livestream was a success and we are looking forward to participating again in the future.

During that time, many students were unable to purchase or gain access to reliable computers to participate in their online classes. Thus, we addressed that need by making a call for computer donations from local businesses and nonprofit organizations.</p>
                  <p class="text-left">Our call received tremendous support and we were able to collect over 60 functional computers. After receiving, testing, and refurbishing these computers to a usable state, our chapter distributed them to UA Little Rock students for free. Due to the positive overall response from the campus community, we are planning to host another technology drive in the future.</p>

This year’s theme was announced to be “Out of Control” and chapter members Gaige Ehrenworth, Julia Green, Samuel Thomas, Joe Filipek, and John Clements quickly got to work. A short 48 hours later, they published their game “The Office Party.” In this game, players must try to maintain control of themselves as they get increasingly drunk at an office party.

                  <p class="text-left">Throughout the lifetime of the ACM Student Chapter of UA Little Rock, many members have formed teams to test their programming and computing mettle in various competitions. For two years, teams have been sent to Jolt Cyber Challenge to employ their skills in cryptography, computer forensics, and computer security. For three years, a team from the organization has created a complete video game in 48 hours for the annual GMTK Game Jam. From these experiences, members of the organization were inspired to host a competition of their own.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-left">The Pi Day Game Jam was inspired from experiences like the GMTK and was hosted on Itch.io, a website for hosting the creations of independent game developers. The task of the competition was to create a game in 24 hours following the theme of Pi (or Pie, if you're so inclined). The competition was open to all students on the UA Little Rock campus and to the general public through Itch.io. A total of 7 teams signed up as the date approached for the 2020 Pi Day Game Jam. Unfortunately, the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic began shortly before the launch of the event. In an effort to preserve the competition, the event was transitioned to operate remotely for its participants. Luckily, the 7 teams were still able to participate in the event after this change.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-left">Following the event, a total of 5 submissions made it in, each more unique of an interpretation of the theme than the last. The winner declared was Cecily Mobley and Phillip Bryan with their submission. The competition ended in a success with enjoyment had by participants and organizers alike. While the pandemic caused a change of course in planning, the ACM Student Chapter was able to still host a memorable event for the computer science community at UA Little Rock.

Of the time spent streaming, a significant portion was dedicated to Dungeons & Dragons. The first session involved the players in a deadly game of Siegeball: an amalgamation of soccer, rugby, and gladiatorial combat. After a short intermission and some more traditional video games, the second session involved the players investigating the mystery of a small hamlet conquered by a monarch 30 years prior.</p>

                  By morning of the second day, everyone was extremely tired. The streamers, despite taking shifts to sleep for an hour or two in the corner, were still going strong playing their games on stream in hopes of raising money. By noon, everyone said their goodbyes to their online audience and began to pack up to go home for some much deserved rest. Overall, the Extra Life Charity Livestream was a success. The ACM Student Chapter of UA Little Rock looks forward to participating again to raise money for sick children in need.
